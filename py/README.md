Python playground
=================

This is just a collection of random Python scripts I've created over the years
of coding.  If you use any of these scripts, send me some love! :D 


Twitters
========

Collection of Twitter scripts to collect various stats about yourself.


Google
========

Some scripts I've written to help with all things Google. For example, 
normalizing your contact phone numbers (because I'm OCD like that) and listing 
all your Google Docs.


Web2Email
========

A small script I wrote long ago to email web pages via cron.  Works, but
probably terrible.


Disclaimer
==========

As a note, if you use *any* of these scripts, use them at your own risk.  Most
of them are fairly trivial in nature and shouldn't be too difficult to use.
With that said, I'll answer a question or two about them, but I don't provide
any support for them.  Sorries.
