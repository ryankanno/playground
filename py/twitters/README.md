How to run these Twitter scripts
================================

Place a json config file called 'twitter.config.json' in the same directory you
run these scripts.  The contents of the file should look like:

    {
        "CONSUMER_KEY": "",
        "CONSUMER_SECRET": "",
        "ACCESS_TOKEN": "",
        "ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET": ""
    }
